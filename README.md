# URL2PP
A clipboard monitor for http/https video file links that will launch PotPlayer 64-bit if a link to a video file or a list of URLs (one URL per line, only line breaks - no spaces or commas accepted) gets copied to the clipboard.
This is entirely written and compiled into a binary using AutoHotKey.
