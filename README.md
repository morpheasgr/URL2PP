# URL2PP
A clipboard monitor for http/https video file links that will launch PotPlayer 64-bit if a link to a video file or a list of video file URLs (one URL per line, only line breaks - no spaces or commas accepted) gets copied to the clipboard.
This is entirely written and compiled into a binary using AutoHotKey.

Download: Go to [Releases section](https://github.com/morpheasgr/URL2PP/releases), download URL2PP.zip from assets. Source-code included.

Prerequisites: PotPlayer **64-bit**. Download from [official site](https://potplayer.daum.net/). (Select 64-bit Download)

USAGE:
1. Unzip
2. Run URL2PP.exe
3. Copy any link to video files.

Supported file types: mp4, mkv, avi, mpg, mpeg, m3u8, ogg, wmv, m2ts, mts, ts, mov, rm, rmvb, m4v, vob, webm, flv, 3gp

Only HTTP/HTTPS links to actual files are supported (actually links containing a file name with a video file extension, but not necessarily ending with the file name).
Created with debrid services such as Real-Debrid or Premiumize in mind, but should work on any hosts providing direct links to video files.
